Welcome to my portfolio of projects as Data Analyst! Here you will find a collection of projects in which I have worked using tools such as Python, Pandas, Numpy, and various visualization libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly and Tableau. In these projects I have applied data manipulation, cleaning, analysis and visualization techniques to answer business questions, make informed decisions and generate valuable insights.

Each project has its own directory with its own README, which explains the context of the project, the objectives pursued, the methodologies used, the results obtained and the main conclusions and recommendations. The projects also include the Python scripts used for analysis and visualization, along with the corresponding datasets (if publicly available).

I hope you enjoy reviewing my projects and find them useful examples of how to apply data analysis tools and techniques in the real world. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me - thanks for visiting my portfolio!
